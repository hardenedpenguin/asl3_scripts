![Supermon2 with Embedded Hamclock](https://github.com/hardenedpenguin/asl3_scripts/blob/main/supermon2_mod%2Bhamclock.png)

---
These scripts are designed for use with [ASL3 (AllStarLink)](https://www.allstarlink.org/) and can enhance your setup by integrating with applications such as **Supermon** and **Hamclock**.

## 1. Supermon2 Mod

If youâ€™re a fan of Supermon2 and like how node info is displayed, this script is for you.

### ðŸ“¥ Download the Script

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hardenedpenguin/asl3_scripts/refs/heads/main/supermon2_mod.sh
```

### ðŸ”§ Make It Executable
```bash
chmod +x supermon2_mod.sh

## 2. Embedded Hamclock Support

This script enables Hamclock to be embedded in Supermon (ASL3+). **Note:** It does not install Hamclockâ€”just patches it into Supermon. If you need to install Hamclock first, visit our dedicated [install_hamclock repo](https://github.com/hardenedpenguin/install_hamclock).

### ðŸ“¥ Download the Script
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hardenedpenguin/asl3_scripts/refs/heads/main/embedded_hamclock_supermon.sh
```

### ðŸ”§ Make It Executable
```bash
chmod +x embedded_hamclock_supermon.sh
```

### ðŸš€ Run the Script
```bash
sudo ./embedded_hamclock_supermon.sh
```

## ðŸ’¬ Support
If you wish to disable HamClock on your node and prevent it from running when rebooted, as your normal user
```
crontab -e
```
You can comment out the line and or remove it, this is totally up to you.
